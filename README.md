# ✈️ High Cloud Airlines – Interactive Data Analytics Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

The **High Cloud Airlines Dashboard** is an end-to-end **data analytics & business intelligence project** built using **SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau**. This repository contains:

* 📊 Interactive dashboards (Power BI & Tableau)
* 🗄️ SQL queries used for data preparation and KPI calculations
* 🖼️ Dashboard preview images for quick visualization

The project focuses on analyzing airline operations, passenger trends, route performance, and **Load Factor efficiency** across multiple dimensions.

## 🔗 Live Assets in This Repository

* 📁 **Power BI Dashboard (.pbix)** – Interactive slicers & measures
* 📁 **Tableau Workbook (.twbx / .hyper)** – Advanced filtering & drill-down
* 📁 **SQL Queries** – `ALL QUERIES SQL.sql`
* 🖼️ **Dashboard Preview Images** – Excel, Power BI & Tableau

---

## 🎯 Business Objectives

* Measure airline operational efficiency using **Load Factor %**
* Analyze passenger traffic by **distance intervals**
* Identify **top routes and carriers** by volume
* Compare **weekday vs weekend** performance
* Track trends across **Year → Quarter → Month**

## 📊 Key KPIs

| KPI                             | Value   |
| ------------------------------- | ------- |
| ✈️ Total Flights                | 110.85K |
| 👥 Total Transported Passengers | 187.02M |
| 💺 Total Available Seats        | 244M    |
| 📈 Load Factor %                | ~77%    |

**Load Factor Formula**:

```sql
Load Factor (%) = (Total Transported Passengers / Total Available Seats) * 100
```

---

## 🧠 SQL – Data Preparation & Analysis

SQL was used extensively for:

* Aggregations & KPI calculations
* Time-based analysis (Year / Quarter / Month)
* Distance interval bucketing
* Ranking top carriers and routes
* Weekday vs weekend comparison

📄 **SQL File**:

```text
ALL QUERIES SQL.sql
```

## 📈 Key Insights

### 📌 Load Factor Trends

* Load Factor improved steadily from **2008 to 2013**
* Minor seasonal fluctuations observed at monthly level

### 📌 Distance Analysis

* Majority of passengers travel **short-haul routes (<1000 miles)**
* Long-haul routes show significantly lower volume

### 📌 Carrier Performance

* **Globespan Airways**, **Allegiant Air**, and **XL Airways France** show highest load factors
* Major US carriers dominate passenger volume

### 📌 Route Analysis

* Busiest routes include **Chicago, Washington, Atlanta, New York**

### 📌 Weekday vs Weekend

* Load Factor remains nearly identical (~77%) across both day types
