# ✈️ High Cloud Airlines – Data Analytics Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

The **High Cloud Airlines Dashboard** is an end-to-end data analytics project that analyzes airline operations, passenger trends, route performance, and load factor efficiency. The project demonstrates how **SQL** is used for data extraction and transformation, while **Excel, Power BI, and Tableau** are used for interactive data visualization.

This project is designed to showcase strong **data analyst skills** including querying, KPI creation, dashboard design, and business insight generation.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze airline performance using **key operational KPIs**
* Track **load factor trends** over time (Year → Quarter → Month)
* Identify **top-performing routes and carriers**
* Compare **weekday vs weekend performance**
* Understand passenger distribution across **distance intervals**

---

## 📊 Key KPIs

* **Total Flights**: 110.85K
* **Total Transported Passengers**: 187.02M
* **Total Available Seats**: 244M
* **Load Factor Percentage**: ~77%

> **Load Factor Formula**:

```
Load Factor (%) = (Total Transported Passengers / Total Available Seats) × 100
```

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

### 🔹 Data Processing

* **SQL** – Data cleaning, aggregation, KPI calculation

### 🔹 Visualization Tools

* **Microsoft Excel** – Initial analysis & dashboard
* **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard & DAX measures
* **Tableau** – Advanced visualization & filters

---

## 🗄️ SQL Usage

SQL queries were used to:

* Calculate total flights, passengers, and seats
* Compute **Load Factor %**
* Group data by **Year, Quarter, Month**
* Analyze flights by **distance intervals**
* Rank **top routes** and **top carriers** by passengers
* Compare **weekday vs weekend** performance

📄 All SQL queries used in this project are available in:

```
/ALL QUERIES SQL.sql
```

## 📈 Dashboard Insights

### 1️⃣ Load Factor Trend

* Gradual improvement from **2008 to 2013**
* Seasonal fluctuations observed monthly

### 2️⃣ Distance Interval Analysis

* Majority of passengers travel **short-haul routes (<1000 miles)**
* Passenger count drops significantly as distance increases

### 3️⃣ Carrier Performance

* **Globespan Airways**, **Allegiant Air**, and **XL Airways France** show the highest load factors
* Major carriers dominate passenger volume

### 4️⃣ Route Analysis

* High-traffic routes include **Chicago**, **Washington**, **Atlanta**, and **New York**
* These routes have the highest flight frequency

### 5️⃣ Weekday vs Weekend

* Load factor remains nearly **equal (~77%)** for weekdays and weekends
